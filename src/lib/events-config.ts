      "A historic event took place in Korea with KK9R Charity teaming up with Mitchell Rudy, a BONK contributor, who broke the [Guinness World Record for the most dogs walked](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2024/10/pooch-perfect-day-out-for-animal-lover-who-walked-38-dogs-at-once-to-promote-adoption) all at once. All 38 dogs that participated were rescued dogs waiting for adoption, going through a week of practice with Mitchell guided by a local well-known dog trainer [Mr.Lee](https://dogtraining.modoo.at/?link=c9fp1bey). This successful attempt in 2024 has helped about 2/3 of the dogs find new homes in the US at the start of 2025 due to increased visibility of the charity. The Guinness World Record event helped raise awareness for stray animals that need good homes domestically and internationally. Read more about it in different publications including [the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2024/10/26/dog-walk-guinness-record-adopt/) and [CBCD articles](https://medium.com/@cbcd/every-paw-helps-244184cb1347).",
