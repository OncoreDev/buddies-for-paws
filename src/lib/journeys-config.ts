    description:
      "Big Papa is a male orangutan adopted through our partnership with Orangutan Outreach. As a young orangutan he was illegally sold as a pet in Taiwan before being rescued and brought to Borneo, where he has been in the care of the BOS foundation since 1994. For many years he lived in isolation due to a hepatitis B diagnosis until a breakthrough discovery revealed his condition posed no risk to others. Today, Big Papa enjoys a life on his own island at the Samboja Lestari Rehabilitation Centre with three female companions. Buddies for Paws is proud to support his life long care and well earned retirement",

      "Our first adoptee, an orphaned baby elephant has been sharing her journey with us.  Nine month old Bani became a victim of a train collision when she was crossing the tracks with a herd of wild elephants.  Left abandoned by the panicked herd, the paralysed elephant calf was discovered in a field beside the tracks.  The baby elephant was found suffering significant injuries on her spine, hips and legs, rendering her unable to stand.  We are committed to providing Bani with the support she needs for her recovery.  Funds raised have gone towards her extensive rehabilitation including acupuncture, daily physical therapies, massage and hydrotherapy and other forms of advanced and holistic care at Wildlife SOS.",

    title: "Meet Dew",
    description:
      "When Dew was rescued from a bear bile farm in Vietnam’s southern Bing Duong province in 2017, her soft, sweet face was expressionless and her eyes vacant from years of suffering.  But she couldn't have known that her rescue from the awful farm was a turning point in her life of unrelenting misery to one filled with healing, kindness and hope.  Since then Dew has received expert veterinary care, rediscovered the feeling of grass beneath her paws, and formed a bond with fellow survivor, Soul.  The two are now inseparable, sharing naps in their concrete tunnel after foraging and embracing a new peaceful life. Buddies for Paws is incredibly proud to be Dew’s official guardian through our support of Animals Asia and we are committed to her ongoing care.",
