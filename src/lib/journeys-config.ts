      "Our first adoptee, an orphaned baby elephant has been sharing her journey with us.  Nine month old Bani became a victim of a train collision when she was crossing the tracks with a herd of wild elephants.  Left abandoned by the panicked herd, the paralysed elephant calf was discovered in a field beside the tracks.  The baby elephant was found suffering significant injuries on her spine, hips and legs, rendering her unable to stand.  We are committed providing Bani with the support she needs for her recovery.  Funds raised have gone towards her extensive rehabilitation including acupuncture, daily physical therapies, massage and hydrotherapy and other forms of advanced and holistic care at Wildlife SOS.",

    description:
      "When Dew was rescued from a bear bile farm in Vietnam’s southern Bing Duong province in 2017, her soft, sweet face was expressionless and her eyes vacant from years of suffering.  But she couldn't have known that her rescue from the awful farm was a turning point in her life of unrelenting misery to one filled with healing, kindness and hope.  Since then Dew has received expert veterinary care, rediscovered the feeling of grass beneath her paws, and formed a bond with fellow survivor, Soul.  The two are now inseparable, sharing naps in their concrete tunnel after foraging and embracing a new peaceful life. Buddies for Paws is incredibly proud to be Dew’s official guardian through our support of Animals Asia and we are committed to her ongoing care.",
